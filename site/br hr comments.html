Let's cover sets. They are also a type of collection. Sets are a type of collection. This means that like lists and tuples, you can input different Python types. Unlike lists and tuples, they are unordered. This means sets do not record element position. Sets only have unique elements. This means there is only one of a particular element in a set. To define a set, you use curly brackets. You place the elements of a set within the curly brackets. You notice there are duplicate items. When the actual set is created, duplicate items will not be present. You can convert a list to a set by using the function set, this is called type casting. You simply use the list as the input to the function set. The result will be a list converted to a set. Let's go over an example. We start off with a list. We input the list to the function set. The function set returns a set. Notice how there are no duplicate elements. Let's go over set operations. These could be used to change the set. Consider the set A. Let's represent this set with a circle. If you are familiar with sets, this could be part of a venn diagram.
